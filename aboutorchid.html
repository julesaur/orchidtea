    <p>Hiya! My name is Orchid Tea and I am Rookie Blogger. I created this blog a while back on WordPress. It gave me the options to start with a template, since I never blogged before. I tried out over 5 different themes within the span of months, then finally used the Baskerville 2 theme which suited me the best. However, I transitioned my WordPress blog to coding it. I never knew I would start over from scratch to rebuild this blog through coding. At first I was like WordPress is so much easier and I just needed to add pictures and texts. On the other hand, there were limitations to it because I wanted to have my own style which gave me the freedom how I wanted to organized it. Therefore, this blog was created!
      <br><br>

In this blog, you’ll come across my past stories and projects to know more about me. I enjoy sharing this to whoever is reading this because it gives me the opportunity to show and write rather than show and talk. It’s not easy talking about myself in front of people and I ended up hesistating, so typing is more of my comfort zone. #introvertxD
<br><br>
I wanted to blog because I get inspired by my favorite websites I always go to and let me tell you it was very beautiful! I also enjoy reading forums and sharing out my opinions which made me sound like a blogger! At first, I wasn't sure on what to blog about because I have so many interests like my favorite celebrity, shows, cooking, however those blogs already existed. So I came to a conclusion to talk about myself. A personal blog which brings out my creative side under the alias "Orchid Tea". In my spare time, I would hula hoop, ride my bike in the park, and have some downtime with romance movies + dramas in my bed.</p>
