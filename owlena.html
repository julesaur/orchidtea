Owls has been my favorite animal since the beginning of middle school. I never knew that I could find a stuffed owl plush toy at stores since it was not a common animal to be a toy. During the 8th grade I wanted to give my friend a birthday present. I didn't have the time to go to the store because her birthday was during the weekday. School Priorities SMH. I knew that my friend really loves collecting stuff animals, so I decided to sacrifice my precious stuffed owl. Don't get me wrong I love giving gifts to my friends, but it was the first time giving away my stuff that I really love to someone I trust. Thankfully, my friend really like the stuff owl and kept it till this day. Whenever I miss my stuffed owl, I would create a CAD version of Owlena.
