      <h3>My Cupid Flower Boy</h3>
      </a>
      <p>I created a short story when I was in tenth grade along with my friend for ideas. The idea came from the term "Flower Boy" which is use to describe a boy with pretty features and is admired by everyone. I discovered a flower breed called Cupid Dart and was thinking of combining with the word Flower Boy and created a fun story about it. The plot was an inspiration from reading Percy Jackson series and I liked the idea of creating a character who is half boy and half flower. Despite of not completing it, I knew I wanted to make it a romantic, comedy, tragic, and mythological genre. </p>

      <h3>Owlena</h3>
    </a>
      <p>This is my stuff owl named Owlena which I bought in middle school. I decided to do a CAD version after I gave it away as a birthday present for one of my friends. It has been years since I last saw it and I wanted to see my stuff owl once again. It wasn't hard to find the exact owl on Google because I remembered it was a blue color. I found that it was called Festive Blue Owl. For this recreation, I started with TinkerCad to piece all the parts together. Next, I uploaded to Fusion 360 to try out the different color and material. Finally, I used Sketchfab to show 3D viewer model.  </p>
