      <h3>My Cupid Flower Boy</h3>
      <p>I created a short story when I was in tenth grade along with my friend for ideas. The idea came from the term "Flower Boy" which was used to describe a boy with pretty features and admired by everyone. I discovered a flower breed called Cupid Dart and was thinking, I should combine it with the world Flower Boy and make a story. The plot was an inspiration from reading Percy Jackson series and I liked the idea of creating a character who is half boy and half flower. Despite of not completing it, I knew I wanted to make it a romantic, comedy, tragic, and mythological genre. </p>

      <h3>Owlena</h3>
      <p>Owls has been my favorite animal since the beginning of middle school. I never knew that I could find a stuffed owl plush toy at stores since it was not a common animal to be a toy. During the 8th grade  I wanted to give my friend a birthday present. I didn't have the time to go to the store because her birthday was during the weekday. School Priorities SMH. I knew that  my friend really loves collecting stuff animals, so I decided to sacrifice my precious owl. Don't get me wrong I love giving gifts to my friends, but it was the first time giving away my stuff that I really love to someone I trust. Thankfully, my friend really like the stuff owl. I even told her to take great care of Owlena. Whenever I miss my stuffed owl, I would create a CAD version of Owlena.</p>
