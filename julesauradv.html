The BFA portfolio review is on November 2nd and I am still in the process of making my website look really great! While scrutinizing my portfolio one more time, I forgot I needed a brand logo as an artist. I am terrible at drawing and I had no idea what I wanted my logo to look like that screams, “Julesaur Adventure”. I was thinking of having a carnival theme because of the word, “Adventure” in it. However, the concept doesn’t match well with the projects that I made so far.
<br> <br>
Now referring to the portfolio, I noticed there’s a flower theme, even the cursor too, so my idea for my logo is to have orchids! Hehe being inspired by the one and only Orchid Tea ^-^. The font for the word was a surprised because I always wanted a “Georgia” font, one of my favorites, but during our conversations, I saw a video that Reyguin sent of the list of fonts. The one font that struck me the most was called, “Hello People” font. I really like the loopy style and I thought it has a childish and elegant look which describes me too. As for the orchids in the picture, I wanted it to be behind the name to have that pop out feel. The orchids act as a background and the name is the center which I think is cool to look at.
