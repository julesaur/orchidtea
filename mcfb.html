Once upon a time, there was a boy hiding behind a tree. 

The boy was named Nico. He was a fairly attractive young man with blue eyes and dark auburn hair. 

Nico looks like an ordinary and innocent human being, but he was not.

He is a flower. A violet-blue flower known as [[Cupid Dart]].

It might sound really cool and girly, but it’s not a gift. It’s a curse.

A minor god named [[Magther]] was furious at him and turned him into a half flower and half-human, [[Dalower]] for eternity. 
<br><br>
Readers: How did Nico get cursed?
<!-- ------------------------------- -->
<br><br>
Before Nico was cursed, he drank a lot of champagne from a wild party and
mistook Magther's shrine for a toilet.
<br><br>
Readers: What a petty god!
<!-- ---------------------------------- -->
<br><br>
Now now, don’t blame him.

After the party, Magther went to his shrine and found a boy lying face down pantless.

Of course, it was none other than Nico who damaged his whole shrine with his mark. 

Magther was very pissed at him and put on a cursed on him.
<br><br>
Readers: What was the curse?
<!-- ------------------------------------ -->
<br><br>
The curse was very cruel for he can only transform into a human if the maiden
(less than 25 and single) sniffs his flower form.

Once Nico turns back to his human form, he must fulfill the maiden's quest on her true love's kiss. 

Alas, after finding the maiden’s soul mate, he turns into a flower again. 

Nico suspected Magther who put the curse him because he knew Magther would give him a punishment someday. Moreover he is the god of punishments and magic afterall. 

Out of all the shrines Nico could've done his business in, it just had to be the god of punishments' shrine.

Nico was to forever locate the maiden's love, but was never to find his own and be reminded of that day when his heart was crushed.
<br><br>
Readers: Why was his heart crushed?
<!-- ----------------------------------- -->
<br><br>
Magther decided to see Nico and make him pay for what he had done. 
   
But first, he uses a crystal ball to locate his whereabouts. 

To his surprise, Magther saw Nico near a garden at the park, but what shocks him the most was he saw Nico kneeling down in front of a petite young lady and holding out in his hands is a Cupid's Dart Flower. 

The minor god was quite amused when Nico was rejected because it’s clear enough that the lady took the flower, ripped the flower in half, slapped his face, and left. Leaving Nico in despair.
<br><br>
Readers: F Magther!
<!-- ----------------------------------- -->
<br><br>
Actually, Nico's fate was suppose to be a cupid dart flower for no particular reason. 

Magther created a punishment for Nico by the time he saw what happened recently from his crystal ball. 
 
He chanted a curse towards the crystal ball directly to Nico. 

In the crystal ball, Magther saw Nico's body brighten up and started becoming smaller and smaller. 

Nico has transformed into a flower. A Cupid's Dart Flower.
<br><br> 
Readers: Can you explain the shrine incident?
<!-- ----------------------------------- -->
<br><br> 
Nico curse was the transformation and finding the maiden’s soulmate.

He went to countless parties after being rejected. 

Moreover, he can be really reckless and irrational towards people. 

Basically he gave up his life. 
<br><br>
Readers: Oof I think he's the petty one for being like this because of a girl!
<!-- ----------------------------------- -->
<br><br>

It gets better when he meets a special someone ;)

During his human form, he cannot say that Magther cursed him to anyone or even the gods. 

Whenever he does his lips are sealed for thirty minutes. 

I mean he can try, but wasn’t able to complete his sentence: “I was cursed by--”,

And zip, his lips are sealed.
<br><br>
Readers: How is Nico doing?
<!-- ----------------------------------- -->
<br><br>
Anyways, as Nico peeked behind the tree, a wide smile spread across his face.
 
That’s a sign meaning his mission has accomplished. 

As the couple walked down the park trail, it was time for Nico to go to the garden.
<br><br>

Readers: Wait I want to read more! This is getting interesting. 
<br><br>
Orchid Tea: Unfortunately, I wasn't able to come up with the rest of the story since I have major writer's block. However, I did came up with the full set characters for the story. 
<br><br>
Readers: Will you able to finish it?
<br><br>
Orchid Tea: Right now, it is still undecided, since this story has been created for 6 years already. This is basically the prologue. If I do have the chance to continue it, it will be on a different platform. :)
<br><br>
Readers: I will be waiting >:(
